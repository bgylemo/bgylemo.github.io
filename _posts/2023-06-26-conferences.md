## Conferences

May and June has included two conferences, one in Heidelberg and one in Berlin. Both have been very enjoyable! I presented more or less the same poster at both conferences, one related to my latest manuscript that's about mapping escape genes in humans. Lots of interesting discussions.

## EMBL Conference: Chromatin and epigenetics
The Heidelberg conference was wonderful, EMBL is located in such a beautiful area. Highly recommend going there! Very well organized. The contents of the conference were not THAT applicable to my own research but I still felt I learned a lot.

## X-chromosome inactivation: New insights on its 60th anniversary
This conference on the other hand was exclusively talks about my own research topic as a whole but still with a width that included subtopics of XCI that I don't work on. Also wonderfully organized and Berlin is always a very nice city to visit. At this conference the entire Nestor lab attended so we were lots of people as well. The conference has really opened my eyes to interesting side projects with interesing hypotheses, where some could lead to small and some large projects. Looking forward to discussing my ideas with the rest of the group.
