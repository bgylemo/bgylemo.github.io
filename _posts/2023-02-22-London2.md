## London: still 10/10
As a small update, things are moving forward with the data I'm analyzing. The biological context of the project was completely new to me when I arrived but I feel I've adapted well. From a technical standpoint I feel I have developed well, this is the first time I'm working with scRNA-seq data (snRNA-seq to be specific). I will be utilizing scRNA-seq when I get back to Linköping so any skills I learn here will be directly transferable (with the small caveat that I'm analyzing 10X data here and will be working on smart-seq2 data in Linköping).

Other than that we had visitors last week and will have visits the coming weekend as well as the weekend after. Fun to show friends and family around London :)
