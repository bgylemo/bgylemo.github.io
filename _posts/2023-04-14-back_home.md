## Back in Linköping
We have been back in Linköping for two weeks now. It feels good to be back! I'm currently preparing for two conferences in the next few months, one in Heidelberg in May and one in Berlin in June. I'm very much looking forward to both, especially the Berlin one which is about X-inactivation. I expected to learn so much at that conference, it's going to be very exciting to present my research there.
